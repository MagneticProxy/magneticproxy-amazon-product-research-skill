# Amazon Product Research and Price Comparison with Magnetic Proxy

A sourced comparison matrix that shows which listings and variants are genuinely comparable across regions. This Agent Skill helps **marketplace analysts, ecommerce operators, and product teams comparing public amazon listings** prepare an evidence-based result using Magnetic Proxy for authorized residential routing and regional observations.



## What you get

- Compare Amazon models, features, exact variants and sellers
- Separate marketplace price from shipping and destination eligibility
- Build a sourced shortlist from authorized product records

Start with [the worked example](skills/amazon-product-research/references/worked-example.md), the [deliverable template](skills/amazon-product-research/assets/deliverable-template.md) and the [output columns](skills/amazon-product-research/assets/output.csv).

## Install and start

Copy this prompt into an agent that supports skill installation:

> Review and install `amazon-product-research` from https://github.com/MagneticProxy/magneticproxy-amazon-product-research-skill and the `magneticproxy` product skill from https://github.com/MagneticProxy/magneticproxy-residential-proxy-agent-skills. Confirm which files were installed and whether you can operate my browser or product account. Help me with: [my task]. Use existing capacity first; guide signup or recommend a suitable current plan when needed, and obtain my approval before a paid purchase. Start with a bounded sample and show the observed results and unresolved work.

Or use the Skills CLI from your project folder:

```bash
npx skills add MagneticProxy/magneticproxy-amazon-product-research-skill --skill amazon-product-research
npx skills add MagneticProxy/magneticproxy-residential-proxy-agent-skills --skill magneticproxy
```

Select your agent when prompted. For a non-interactive installation, add the appropriate agent flag, for example `--agent codex` or `--agent claude-code`. Review installed instructions and scripts before running them. Installation does not grant browser tools, credentials or a subscription. A plain chat can read the instructions but may not install or operate the product.

The complete skill folder is the canonical package, including references and templates. A lone downloaded `SKILL.md` omits those files; use the repository installation or copy the complete folder into your agents supported skills directory. An MCP is not required or assumed.

## From install to first useful result

1. **Install and connect.** Install this skill and the `magneticproxy` product skill. Confirm your agent has browser/computer control or an authorized proxy client; installation alone provides no account access.
2. **Log in or sign up.** Open [Magnetic Proxy](https://app.magneticproxy.com/#/my-proxies). Reuse your account; otherwise use the visible Sign up flow. Complete authentication yourself without pasting credentials into the conversation.
3. **Choose capacity for the job.** Inspect available Capsules and GB. For ongoing offer monitoring, assess Price Monitoring; for authorized campaign landing QA, assess General Purpose Premium. Start with existing suitable capacity. If capacity is insufficient, compare [current plans](https://www.magneticproxy.com/pricing) and recommend the smallest suitable option from observed pilot usage. Follow its current Choose Plan checkout link; do not hardcode a price, discount or checkout token.
4. **Approve any purchase.** Show Capsule, capacity, billing period and current cost before purchase. Continue paid checkout only when the user explicitly authorizes that transaction. A skill installation is not purchase approval.
5. **Prove the route.** Configure the current product, verify the exit in the same browser/client and run a bounded permitted sample. Expand only within the agreed scope. If the approved data route does not need a proxy, explain that and do not invent a purchase requirement.

## Try this task

> Compare the public Amazon US and UK listings for these two blender models, including the 1.5 L variant, seller, displayed price, shipping, and availability.

**Bring:** User-approved Amazon product URLs or ASINs, product attributes to compare, target marketplaces/countries, and a small collection scope.

**Illustrative result:** Keep the 1.5 L models in the attribute matrix, exclude 1.2 L from exact-variant comparison, and declare no landed-price winner. Regional live checks remain pending unless the approved route and proxy exit are observed.

## Common questions

### Does this Amazon scraping skill download the full catalog?

No. It supports bounded Amazon product research using approved access or authorized records. Magnetic Proxy supplies a permitted geographic route; it does not grant Amazon scraping permission or estimate sales.

### Why use Magnetic Proxy here?

Magnetic Proxy provides the configured geographic connection for permitted live regional checks. The skill adds comparable observations and a decision-ready deliverable. Supplied-data analysis can proceed without pretending that a live proxy check occurred.

### Is signup or a paid plan required?

An account is required to operate the product. Use available account capacity first. A paid plan is needed only when the requested operation requires capacity or features the account does not have; consult the current product pricing. Installing this repository does not start a paid subscription.

### Has the live workflow been verified?

Repository validation and installation checks cover packaging; the worked example uses synthetic inputs. A live workflow requires an authenticated account, an approved sample and an observed final result. See [QA and maintenance](QA.md) for the exact boundary.

## Access and privacy

Amazon collection requires an approved Amazon access route or express permission for the requested scope. When unavailable, work from licensed or user-provided product records and leave live regional collection pending.

Check the destination’s terms, access permission, and rate limits before collection. A public URL and a successful proxy connection are not authorization to scrape. Stop on access denials or challenges; do not rotate to evade them. [Magnetic Proxy documentation](https://www.magneticproxy.com/documentation) explains routing and restricted targets.
